# Certificate Manager

TODO: review and complete

[https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/)

The kubernetes certificate manager is needed as AFAIK the ingresses configured by the Kong Ingress Controller don't integrate with the ALB Ingress Controllers and respective auto-magic certificate generator.
